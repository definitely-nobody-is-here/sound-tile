# Sound Tile
An app that lets you visualize music (or other sounds) in tiles.

Like [corrscope](https://github.com/corrscope/corrscope) but with a spectrum analyzer instead of an oscilloscope.

document the rest of the stuff here, unfortunately parts have to be uploaded separately (so export them separately or good luck lol)
