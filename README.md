# Sound Tile
An app that lets you visualize music (or other sounds) in tiles.

Like [corrscope](https://github.com/corrscope/corrscope) but with a spectrum analyzer instead of an oscilloscope. (and also runs in the browser)

Just download the thing and open it in your browser or something, most of it's pretty self-explainatory.

Uses [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) and [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate).
